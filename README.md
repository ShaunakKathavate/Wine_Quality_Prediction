# Wine_Quality_Prediction

Executive Summary


This capstone project aimed to develop a machine learning model for predicting the quality of red wines based on various chemical and physical features. The chosen model, a Random Forest Regression, was trained and evaluated using the Wine Quality dataset. The model demonstrated promising results in predicting wine quality, as evidenced by a low Mean Squared Error (MSE) during evaluation.


Introduction

Problem Statement

Predicting wine quality is a crucial task in the wine industry, as it can assist producers in maintaining and improving the overall quality of their products. This project aimed to leverage machine learning techniques to create a predictive model for wine quality based on measurable attributes.


Objectives

The primary objectives of the project were to:
1.	Develop a machine learning model to predict wine quality.
2.	Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
3.	Explore the potential application of the model in predicting the quality of new wines.


Data Exploration and Preprocessing

Data Source

The Wine Quality dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes features such as acidity, alcohol content, and sulfur dioxide levels, with wine quality as the target variable.
Data Exploration
Exploratory data analysis revealed insights into the distribution of features and the correlation between variables. Visualizations and summary statistics were used to gain a better understanding of the dataset.
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, separating features (X) and target variable (y), and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.



Methodology


Model Selection

The Random Forest Regression was selected as the machine learning model due to its ability to handle non-linearity and capture complex relationships within the data.
Model Training
The model was trained using the training set, consisting of a subset of the Wine Quality dataset.


Model Evaluation

Performance Metrics

The model's performance was evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE), a metric suitable for regression tasks.
Results
The evaluation results demonstrated a low MSE, indicating that the model effectively predicted wine quality on the test set.



Application and Future Work

Predicting Wine Quality

The trained model can be applied to predict the quality of new wines by providing their chemical and physical attributes. This could be valuable for winemakers seeking to assess and improve the quality of their products.
Limitations
Limitations include the assumption of a linear relationship between features and wine quality, potential bias in the dataset, and the need for further exploration of hyperparameters for model optimization.
Future Work
Future work could involve refining the model by exploring different algorithms, conducting feature engineering, and incorporating additional datasets for a more comprehensive analysis.


Conclusion

In conclusion, this capstone project successfully developed and evaluated a machine learning model for predicting wine quality. The model demonstrated promising results, opening avenues for further research and practical applications within the wine industry.
